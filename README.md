# About
[Batak](https://gamerules.com/rules/batak/) is a popular Turkish card game typically played by four players. Players use a standard 52-card deck and aim to win a certain number of tricks (rounds) based on a contract declared at the beginning of the game. The game requires strategy and prediction skills.
Project Purpose
